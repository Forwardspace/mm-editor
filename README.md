# Murder Mystery Editor

This is a GUI built for authoring rules and settings in the procedural rules-based murder mystery
scenario system built in collaboration with @marinprusac. Check out the system [here](https://github.com/marinprusac/HalloweenSystem)


This software aims to make the process of authoring input files to the system more approachable for people
with little to no experience with programming, but also more generally to reduce errors while writing the
input files.
